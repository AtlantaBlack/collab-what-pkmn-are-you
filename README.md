# What Kind of Pokémon Are You?
A collaborative project to discover kind of Pokémon you are based on music preference.

## About

Utilises APIs to  discover what type of Pokémon you are based on musical preferences. The user inputs a musician/artist and the app generates your Pokémon. Details about the Pokémon will emerge after you click the acceptance button, which pairs the genre of your artist with a corresponding Pokémon type (or random Pokémon).
